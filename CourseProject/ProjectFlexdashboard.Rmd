**About the Data**
  
The dataset for this project comes from the City of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal and contains information about crime in Chicago during 2018. A sampling of 15,000 rows was taken from the original 267,000+ rows with the objective to develop a predictive model for arrests. Phase I of the project consisted of reviewing and cleaning the data, then isolating variables that may affect the arrest rate.  
  
The isolated variables were broken into 3 categories; Crime (Type and Domestic), Time (Hour), and Location (District and Description).
